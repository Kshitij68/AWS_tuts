The AWS Shared Responsibility Model
    Customer and AWS share responsibility of securing data

    AWS Responsible
        Security of Cloud
            - AWS Foundation Services (Compute, Storage, Databases, Networking)
            - Physical security
            - Global Infrastructure including regions, availability zones and edge locations
            - Third party reports are available
            - Handles basic security tasks for DynamoDB, RDS, Redshift, ElastiMapReduce, Workspaces
                - OS and database patching
                - Firewall configuration
                - Disaster Recovery

    Customer responsible
        - Logical access controls
        - Protect account credentials
        - Customers are responsible of the security of everything they put in the cloud
            - Maintain complete control over the content
            - What to store
            - Which AWS services are used with the content
            - In what country the content is stored
            - Content format and structure
            - Who has access to the content
            - How the access right are created, managed and revoked

    The Shared responsibility model changes based on the service the customer uses

    AWS is responsible for security of the cloud
    Customers are responsible for security in the cloud

AWS Access Control and Management
    - Control access to AWS Resources
    - Authentication:  Who can use the resources
    - Autherization: How they can use the resources

    - Users: End users
    - Groups: Group of users
    - Permissions: Applied to group of users or users
    - Roles: Trusted Entities

    - Manage IAM users and access
    - Manage IAM roles and their permissions
    - Manage federated users and permissions

    - AWS Authentication
        - Programmatic Access
            - Enables access key ID / secret access key
            - AWS API, CLI, SDK etc.
        - Management Console
            - Sigh in to the console
            - Uses AWS account name and password
            - MFA if enabled
    - Responsibility of customer to define password policies

    - IAM Best Practices
        - Delete AWS root account access keys
        - Activate multi-factor authentication (MFA)
        - Give IAM users only the permission they need
        - Use IAM groups
        - Apply an IAM password policy
        - Use roles for applications
        - Use roles instead of sharing credentials
        - Rotate credentials regularly
        - Remove unnecessary users and credentials
        - Use policy conditions for extra secutiry
        - Monitor activity in your account

AWS Security Compliance Programs
    Discussions on:-
