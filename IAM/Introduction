Why do we need Access Management?
Say you have a company which has a server. This server has all the modules, which gives different users permission.
You need to have an administrator who has all the permissions
When a UI developer comes in the company, he should only have access to the graphical tools.
If a business analyst comes in, only the analytics modules should be accessible in the server.
Therefore, each role should have only certain set of rights that they deserve.

What is IAM?
IAM is a service from AWS using which you can give permissions to different users who are using the same AWS account that you have created
You can have one AWS account who can work on different things.
You can assign policies to limit access the AWS services

Components of IAM
Users: You can create and manage AWS users. When AWS account is created, it is a root account. Any person who wants to use AWS account has to be added as a user.
Groups: All users need to be given identical access
Roles: Similar to users. But they are assigned to applications. Say, you are creating EC2 instance and inside EC2 instance you are hosting a web application. Now that has been designed in such a way, that interacts with S3 service. For application to interact with S3 service I have to give it permissions.
Policies: To create permissions to user, group, role or resource, you create a policy, which is a document explicitly listing the permissions

Multi-Factor Authentication
You can configure your AWS account. When you enter username and password, it will ask for a code.
Google Authenticator can be used for Multi-Factor Authenticator
