AWS Compute Domain services:
EC2
    Can install any kind of operating system
    Can configure it to become a web-server, to become a worker environment
Elastic Beanstalk
    Automated version of EC2
    No access to operating system. But have control over the operating system
AWS Lambda
    Don't get access to operating system
    No option of configuration
    Just upload a code
    Useful for executing background tasks

AWS Lambda is server-less computing service
Just upload code and it is executed (used to execute background tasks)

AWS SDKs
One can simplify using AWS Services in your applications with an API tailored to your programming language or platform
AWS SDKs are called Software Development Kits, which are APIs defined for specific programming language
These APIs can be integrated with an IDE and thus can be used with ease
