Amazon EC2 Key Features
-> Providing re-sizble compute capacity in the cloud
-> Designed to make web-scale cloud computing easier
-> A true virtual computing environment
-> Launch instances with a variety of operating systems
-> Run as many or few systems as you desire

Basic Characterstics
-> Completely Controlled
-> Elastic
-> Flexible
-> Web-Scale
-> Reliable
-> Secure
-> Easy to start
-> Inexpensive

Agenda
-> Amazon EC2 Concepts & Fundamentals
-> Storage & Networking
-> Monitoring, Metrics & Logs
-> Security & Access Control
-> Deployment
-> Cost Optimisation

Amazon EC2 Concepts
-> The geographical region where AWS EC2 will launch the instances you create
-> Choose region to optimise latency, minimise costs, or address regulatory requirements

Instances
-> Amazon EC2 provides wide selection of types optimized to fit different use cases
-> Instance types comprise varying combinations of CPU, memory, storage and networking capacity

Instance Types (serviced with resources in different ratios)
-> General Purpose (M4)
-> Compute Optimized (C4)
-> Memory Optimized (R3)
-> GPU Optimized (G2)
-> Storage Optimized (D2)
-> IO Optimized (I2)
-> Low cost, burst-able performance (T2)

i2.xlarge (Storage - Optimized) <=> Generation.Type(Family)

T2: Allocated baseline performance level
