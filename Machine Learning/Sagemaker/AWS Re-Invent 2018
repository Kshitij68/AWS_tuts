Machine Learning applications core part is to build something to do predictions

As part of model you take input as labelled dataset
The need for quality training data is quite important for high quality results

Data labeling is hard
-> Need to label large datasets
-> Requires human to perform labeling
-> Becomes time consuming and costly
-> Difficult to achieve high-accuracy for labels

Amazon Sagemaker: Build, train and deploy ML
-> Pre-built notebooks for common problems: Collect and prepare training data
-> Built in high performance algorithms: Choose and optimize your ML algorithm
-> One-click training: Set up and manage environments for training
-> Optimization: Train and tune model (trial and error)
-> One-Click Deployment: Deploy model in production
-> Fully managed with auto-scaling: Scale and manage the production environment

Amazon Sagemaker: Ground Truth
-> Adds data preparation and labelling also
-> Makes data labelling easy and cheap
-> Supports built in workflows or labelling tasks inlcuding:-
    Bounding Boxes
    Image Classification
    Semantic Segmentation
    Text Classification
    Custom Tasks
-> Ground truth uses active learning and auto-labeling
    It starts with input data you provide. Active learning takes some input set and allows the users to label them. These are used by ground truth to train a machine learning model

Human Workforce Options
-> Public: Through Amazon Mechanical Turk
-> Private: Team of workers you have sourced yourself
-> Vendor: Curated set of workforce that specialize in providing labeling services
