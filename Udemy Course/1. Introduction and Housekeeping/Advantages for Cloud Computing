Six Advantages of Cloud Computing
1. Trade Capital Expense for Variable Expense
-> Traditional on premise datacenters require upfront heavy capital investment
-> With cloud, you pay only when you consume resources and pay only for how much you consume
-> Detailed billing reports - Helps you optimize your costs

2. Benefit from Massive Economies of Scale
-> Shared infrastructure used by hundreds and thousands of customers
-> Lower pay-as-go prices
-> Lower variable cost with cloud computing that traditional on premise data centers

3. Stop guessing about Capacity
-> Eliminate guessing on your infrastructure capacity needs
-> Capacity decisoin prior to deploying an application often results in overcapacity with idle resources or under capacity with constrained resources
-> With cloud, you can scale up or down with only a few minutes notice

4. Increase Speed and Agility
-> In cloud, new resources are only a click away
-> Developers can get resources in minutes instead of waiting for weeks
-> Cost to experiment and develop is significantly lower
-> Hourly pricing model - try new products at very low cost

5. Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers
-> Avoid undifferentiated heavy lifting
-> Focus on projects that differentiate your business, not infrastructure

6. Go Global in Minutes
-> Easily deploy application in multiple regions around the world
-> Keep resourcse near the customer for lower latency and compliance requirements
-> Better end user experience at minimal cost
