-> Enterprise Data Warehouse on AWS (Amazon Redshift)
-> Serverless Queries from your Data Warehouse (Redshift Spectrum)
-> Serverless Data Catalog (AWS Glue)
-> Serverless ETL (AWS Glue)
-> Serverless BI (Amazon QuickSight)
-> Demonstration
-> Wrap up

What is serverless?
Virtualized => Managed => Serverless

Virtualized
-> You can easily provision servers and focus on OS and above

Managed
-> You focus higher in the stack but still need to consider servers, how much CPU is needed, and much RAM. AWS manages based on customer configuration

Server-less
-> Build applications and services without thinking of servers
-> Don't be concerned about provisioning, scaling and maintaining servers for fault tolerance and availability. AWS does all for you.

Server-less Characteristics
-> No servers to provision or manage
-> Scales with usage
-> Never pay for idle resources
-> Availability and fault tolerance built-in

Enterprise Data Warehouse
-> Managed massively parallel petabyte scale data warehouse
-> Streaming backup/restore to S3
-> Load data from S3, DynamoDB and EMR
-> Extensive Security Features
-> Online Scaling from 160Gb -> 2 PB

Amazon Redshift Spectrum
Run SQL queries directly against data in S3 using thousands of nodes
-> Fast @ exabyte scale
-> Elastic & highly available
-> On-demand, pay-per-query
-> High Concurrency: Multiple clusters access same data
-> No ETL: Query data in-place using open file formats
-> Full Amazon Redshift support

Data can be pushed to S3 in JSON, Parque or CSV format and then the schema can be defined using data catalog (using Glue) and easily query that dataset


Redshift Spectrum
-> Leverages Amazon's Redshift advanced cost-based optimizer
-> Pushed down projections, filters, aggregations and join reduction
-> Dynamic partition pruning to minimize data processed
-> Automatic parallelization of query execution against S3 data
-> Efficient join processing within the Amazon Redshift cluster


AWS Glue
-> Discover: Automatically discover and categorizes your data to make it immediately searchable and queryable
-> Develop: Generates code to clean, enrich, and reliably move data between data stores; you can also use their favorite tools to build ETL jobs
-> Deploy: Runs your jobs on server-less, fully managed, scale-out environment without needing to provision or manage compute resources

AWS Glue: Components
Data Catalog:
    Apache Hive Metastore compatible with enhanced functionality
    Crawlers automatically extract metadeta and create tables
    Integrated with Amazon Athena, Amazon Redshift Spectrum
Job Authoring:
    Auto generate ETL code
    Built on open frameworks - Python and Spark
    Developer centric - editing, debugging, sharing
Job Execution:
    Runs jobs on serverless Spark platform
    Provides flexible scheduling
    Handles dependency resolution, monitoring, and alerting

Amazon QuickSight
About: Business analytics service that lets business users quickly and easily visualize, explore, and share insights from the data
Data Sources: Wide number of data sources built into quick-sight
Integration: S3, RDS, Redshift, Athena, Excel
Performance: SPICE (Super-fast Parallel In-memory optimized Calculation Engine) delivers unprecedented performance and scale, delivering insights at the speed of thought
